# Spell-Checker
a spell checker that can check spelling of a document by getting its words one by one and then comparing it with a dictionary. So that, if a word is found in that dictionary then the word is spelled correctly, else it is wrong and there must be suggestions for correct spelling. a dictionary will be made using data structure, it can be a trie or hash table. The dictionary will be implemented as an array of 26 Lists; each list will contain the words that start with a particular letter of the alphabet. To spell check a particular word (e.g., "computer"), the program will locate the appropriate list (e.g., the list of words beginning with "C") and then check to see whether the word is contained in the list.
